Hi my name is Joseph Arias I am a computer science major and I have taken discrete
math, discrete and continuous algorithms, and operating systems. I am currently collaborating on
a project with a group and it's meant to be a website for clubs where they can post events and have
a history of events on their page. It will also have more features like meeting the members or
messaging this club to collaborate. The project will make use of the MERN stack and I am
currently doing front-end work but I am currently learning more about the backend and will also
work on the backend soon. The inspiration for this project was to help make clubs more visible
and provide a more customizable platform for clubs to better express what they are and
what they do.

I think this course will be the most important course I take in my four years of college
because I want to be a software engineer. The technologies I learn while taking this course will
be used to make full stack websites which will help me secure jobs in the near future. Beyond
this it will also help have a deeper understanding of how websites work in general and help me
answer a lot of questions I have. I am also really looking forward to understanding how backend
works because I think that part of a website can get really complicated.
