apparently vite is a scaffolder
created by the creator of vue (platform agnostic)"works super well with react as well"
for React Next is useful (search why)
Pinia good but often times not needed
Unit testing (every individual functions...)very important 
End to end testing (Cypress)very important
ESLint (for code quality catches stupid errors helps with consistency) a lot less important with  TypeScript

installed recommended vscode extensions in client/.vscode and also vue snippet tool by Lettuce

public for static files

only one gitignore (we have a monorepo) -- eventually we will have 3 or more npm projects

typescript env.d.ts (definitions not real code "labels" maybe)

hot module replacement ( HMR)

tsconfig will be editted later on

to run commands after (then) you have to cd into client to install packages from package.json since the one you want to download is in client
commands used =>

npm create vite@latest 

then =>

cd client
npm install "or" npm i
npm run dev // it is to constantly update page and run it

(variant chosen was custom)

2/26/24

commands used =>

cd client

npm run build // does type checking and shows you all the errors helps debugn

npm run preview //  this opens up your app in browser fully compiled version

npm run dev // updates changes automatically to app

----------------------------------
// npm run dev // does not do type checking for typescript its meant to just quick
package.JSON outside meant for server folder not for

added package.JSON // to dependencies // ^ latest features

whenever you add to package.JSON run npm  install // to make sure everything is installed correctly

svg version for fonts has trouble loading so go the other way
